			<div class="box-1"><h3>What is <em>Gaseous Exchange?</em></h3>
			<br><p>For cellular respiration to take place the respiratory system makes Oxygen available and the byproduct Carbon dioxide is eliminated.
			Gaseous Exchange is the exchange of Oxygen and Carbon dioxide across a gaseous exchange surface.For this to take place <em>breathing</em> has to take place.Breathing is the mechanical process whereby air moves into and out of the lungs.When air is breathed it is said inhalation/inspration has taken place and when air is is breathed out exhalation/expiration has taken place.</p><br>
